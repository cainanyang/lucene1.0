Lucene Source Release

To build Lucene from source, you must first install the following:

  1. Jakarta Ant

     Please go to <http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/> and follow the
     instructions for installing the binary version of Ant. You will
     also need to get the jakarta-ant-optional.jar from the distribution
     directory on the website because JavaCC is an optional task.

  2. JDK

     Set the JDK_HOME environment variable to the location of your JDK
     installation.  JDK releases can be downloaded from Sun or IBM
     (http://java.sun.com/j2se/ or http://www.ibm.com/java/).

Once you have installed the requirements above, you can build Lucene
by simply typing: 'ant' in the lucene source distribution directory.

For example:

    cd lucene; ant

This will generate a lucene.jar file located in the lucene/ant.build
directory.
