Adding to lucene, and becoming a lucene developer

The policy is that first-time contributions should be made by posting them
to lucene-dev.  Existing developers can then review them, and if they look
reasonable, commit them.  Only when a developer gains a track record of
useful, high-quality contributions should they be able to make contributions
directly.

So please don't just ask to be made a developer.  First post changes or
additions to lucene-dev.  Then, if you get positive feedback, send mail to
the list asking to be added as a developer.  Also, don't mail me or other
developers directly.  Use this list.  We shouldn't add developers without
other developers being aware of this.
